#' Read multiple tables into a single data frame.

#' @param pattern A regular expression that matches file names. If the pattern has
#'     parenthesized groups, the part of the file name that matches the 1st group is
#'     placed in the 'tag' column for that file's entries. If there are no groups tags are
#'     generated from sequential integers.
#' @return A tibble formed by stacking the frames from each file and appending a 'tag'
#'     column.
